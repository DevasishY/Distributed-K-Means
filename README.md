# Distributed-K-Means 
This repository contains a distributed implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm using mpi4py. The implementation leverages the Message Passing Interface (MPI) to distribute the computational workload across multiple processors, enabling efficient clustering of large datasets.

##Prerequisites
Before running the code, ensure you have the following installed:

Python: Version 3.x
mpi4py: Python bindings for MPI
MPI Implementation: Such as OpenMPI or MPICH

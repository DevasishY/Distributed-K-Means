"# Distributed-K-Means" 
This repository contains a distributed implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm using mpi4py. The implementation leverages the Message Passing Interface (MPI) to distribute the computational workload across multiple processors, enabling efficient clustering of large datasets.
